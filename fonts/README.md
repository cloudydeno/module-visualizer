# Fonts

I use Archivo for the website, and Arial for exported SVGs.

These files aren't actually served or rendered.
graphviz uses them to measure text, for box sizing purposes.

## Sources

I'm sure there's more legit sources for these fonts...
I got these files from these URLs:

* https://github.com/Omnibus-Type/ArchivoNarrow/raw/master/fonts/ttf/ArchivoNarrow-Regular.ttf
* https://github.com/matomo-org/travis-scripts/raw/master/fonts/Arial.ttf
