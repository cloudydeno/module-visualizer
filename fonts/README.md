# Fonts

I use Archivo for the website, and Arial for exported SVGs.

These TTFs aren't actually served or rendered.
graphviz uses them to measure text, for box sizing purposes.

The WOFF2 files **are** served, to optimize pageload times.

## Sources

The WOFF2 files are from Google Fonts. They were grabbed from
[this reference CSS file](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Archivo+Narrow:wght@400;700&display=swap).

I'm sure there's more legit sources for these TTFs...
I got these files from these URLs:

* https://github.com/Omnibus-Type/ArchivoNarrow/raw/master/fonts/ttf/ArchivoNarrow-Regular.ttf
* https://github.com/matomo-org/travis-scripts/raw/master/fonts/Arial.ttf
